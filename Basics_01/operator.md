# Operators

> In JavaScript, **operators** are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values. They allow you to manipulate data, compare values, or assign values to variables.

### **Types of Operators in JavaScript**:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations (e.g., addition, subtraction).
2. **Assignment Operators**: Used to assign values to variables (e.g., `=`, `+=`).
3. **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare two values (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<=`).
4. **Logical Operators**: Used to perform logical operations, often with Boolean values (e.g., `&&`, `||`).
5. **Bitwise Operators**: Perform operations on binary representations of numbers (e.g., `&`, `|`).
6. **Unary Operators**: Operate on a single operand (e.g., increment `++`, decrement `-`).
7. **Ternary Operator**: A shorthand for `if-else` statements (e.g., `condition ? expr1 : expr2`).
8. **Spread Operator**: Expands elements in arrays and objects (e.g., `...`).
9. **Nullish Coalescing Operator**: Checks for `null` or `undefined` (e.g., `??`).
